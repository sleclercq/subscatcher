subscatcher
===========
A little automatic english subtitles downloader. It will scan every hour for videos without subtitles and attempt to search/download them from opensubtitles. I did it for me so the code is very straightforward, specific to my needs and I didn't spend time to clean it but if you want to improve on it you're welcome :)

To use, adapt config_example.properties to your liking and rename it to config.properties.
